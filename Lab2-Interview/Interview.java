/*
 * This lab is intended to be completed in one recitation, but will be extended into the next lab session 
 * in order to allow more than enough time to complete it.
 * 
 * Essentially, you will create a Scanner object and use its methods in conjunction with print statements
 * to simulate an ask-and-read dialog with a user. 
 * 
 * You will ask the user to provide their name (as a single word, assume first name here)
 * You will ask the user their age in full years (no fraction or months)
 * You will ask the user how many full months since their last birthday (again, whole numbers here).
 * 
 * You will use this information to calculate the user's age in months and use that information to print
 * out a greeting.
